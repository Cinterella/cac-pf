At age eighteen, Dumbledore met Gellert Grindelwald. They both created a blood pact to never fight one another, both appearing unbreakable.

                        However, his younger sister, Ariana, was killed in a three-way-duel between Albus and Aberforth and Gellert Grindelwald. Unaware of which spell killed her, Grindelwald fled the scene, which haunted Albus in his older years.</p>

Became the immediate enemy of James Potter and Sirius Black and was a frequent victim of their bullying. This led him to be irritable towards James's son Harry when he was a professor.Shortly before Lily Evans was murdered by Lord Voldemort, Snape changed sides and became a member of the Order of the Phoenix as well as a double agent during the Second Wizarding War.</p>
