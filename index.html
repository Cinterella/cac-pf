                    <p class="history">Godric Gryffindor was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was known for his bravery and daring personality, traits he highly valued and sought in students for his house. Gryffindor's sword, a goblin-made weapon, is enchanted to appear to any worthy Gryffindor in need. This sword has played a significant role in several key events, including the destruction of Horcruxes in the fight against Voldemort.</p>

                    <h2 class="name">Slytherin</h3>
                    <p class="history">Salazar Slytherin was known for his cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition. He valued pure-blood status and believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magical families. His house often attracts students with leadership qualities and a certain ruthlessness. Slytherin's creation of the Chamber of Secrets, which housed a basilisk, was intended to purge the school of Muggle-born students.</p>

                    <p class="history">Helga Hufflepuff was renowned for her kindness, fairness, and loyalty. Unlike the other founders, Helga was inclusive, willing to accept students of all abilities and backgrounds, provided they were hardworking and loyal. She was particularly adept at food-related charms, many of which are still used in the Hogwarts kitchen</p>

                    <p class="history">Rowena Ravenclaw was famed for her intelligence and creativity. She valued learning and wisdom above all, and sought students who shared her passion for knowledge. Her house produced many of the greatest thinkers and innovators in the wizarding world. The diadem of Ravenclaw, said to enhance the wisdom of its wearer, became one of Voldemortâ€™s Horcruxes, though it was ultimately destroyed.</p>
